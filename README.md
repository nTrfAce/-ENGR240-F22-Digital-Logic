# ENGR240-F22-Digital-Logic

APU Engineering and Computer Science has used the [Lattic Semiconductor iCEstick](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/lattice-semiconductor-corporation/ICE40HX1K-STICK-EVN/4289604) as the FPGA development board for a few years in our [ENGR 240 Digital Logic](http://catalog.apu.edu/search/?search=ENGR+240) course, but this semester it is out of stock everywhere.

Students are creating carrier boards which will make use of the [Devantech iceWerx module](https://www.robotshop.com/en/devantech-icewerx-ice40-hx8k-fpga.html).  Each student will design a PCB which they will then solder, test, and use as their development board which they will use while learning Digital Logic, first with simple gate-level designs, then non-trivial systems using the Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL).
